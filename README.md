This repository contains **C programs** for the **Computer Networks Laboratory (IT-3095)** course at KIIT University. The programs are organized **lab-wise** according to the official lesson plan.

---

## 📚 Overview
This repository includes implementations for:
- Pointers, structures, and endianness in C
- Upcoming modules: socket programming (TCP/UDP), packet analysis, I/O multiplexing, and network design simulations

## 🗂 Repository Structure & Program Links

### **Lab 1** – Pointers, Structures & Endianness
1. [Swap two variables using pointer](https://github.com/tarunkrjaiswal/CN/blob/main/Day%201/q1.c)  
2. [Assign and display structure members (call-by-address)](https://github.com/tarunkrjaiswal/CN/blob/main/Day%201/q2.c)  
3. [Extract each byte from a number](https://github.com/tarunkrjaiswal/CN/blob/main/Day%201/q3.c)  
4. [Store number in structure & reconstruct original number](https://github.com/tarunkrjaiswal/CN/blob/main/Day%201/q4.c)  
5. [Check endianness and convert between little/big endian](https://github.com/tarunkrjaiswal/CN/blob/main/Day%201/q5.c)

## ⚙️ Compilation & Execution
Compile each C program using GCC:
```bash
gcc program_name.c -o output_name
./output_name
